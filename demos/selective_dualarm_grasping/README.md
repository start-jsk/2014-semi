# Advanced Robotics 2020: Selective dual-arm occluded grasping

## Download models

```bash
rosrun dualarm_grasping install_models.py
```

## Sampling

### Setup

```bash
roslaunch dualarm_grasping baxter.launch
roslaunch dualarm_grasping setup_occluded_sampling.launch
```

Pass args for `first_sampling:=true` or `second_sampling:=true`

### Main Program

```bash
roseus euslisp/sampling-grasp.l
```

## Execution (Cluster Grasping)

### Setup

```bash
roslaunch dualarm_grasping baxter.launch
roslaunch dualarm_grasping setup_occluded_picking.launch
```

### Main Program

```bash
roseus euslisp/dualarm-grasp.l
```

## Execution (Target Grasping)

### Setup

```bash
roslaunch dualarm_grasping baxter.launch
roslaunch dualarm_grasping setup_occluded_picking.launch target_grasp:=true
```

### Main Program

```bash
roseus euslisp/dualarm-grasp.l
```

## Evaluation (Target Grasping)

### Setup

```bash
roslaunch dualarm_grasping baxter.launch
roslaunch dualarm_grasping setup_occluded_test.launch target_grasp:=true
```

### Main Program

```bash
roseus euslisp/test-grasp.l
```
